          <h3>Do I Really Need An Immigration Lawyer?</h3>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, immigrants are not eligible for free legal
            representation from the U.S. government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Studies show that immigrants with attorneys are{" "}
            <strong>3.5 times </strong>more likely to be released from detention
            and up to <strong>10 times</strong> more likely to establish their
            right to remain in the United States than those without
            representation.
